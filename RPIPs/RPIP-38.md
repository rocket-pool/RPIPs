## Abstract
This proposal looks to challenge the GMC decision on application [BA082401](https://github.com/rocketpoolgmc/rocketpool-gmc/blob/main/bounties/BA082401.md), the funding of an integration with Eigenlayer.

## Specification
The pDAO SHALL vote twice:

1. SHALL the bounty be rejected?
2. If not, SHALL the bounty be reduced to Milestone 0 (Research informing the implementation)

- If the first vote passes, the bounty SHALL be voided.
- If the first vote fails, the bounty SHALL be modified according to the result of the second vote:
  - If the second vote passes, the bounty SHALL be modified to remove milestones A, B and C, and to change the overall funding to $10,000.
  - If the second vote fails, the bounty SHALL be upheld as written.

## Rationale
Funding an integration with Eigenlayer has the potential to attract many node operators, but also the potential to create additional risks to rETH holders.
Arguments both that Rocket Pool will suffer if it does and suffer if it does not integrate with Eigenlayer are prevalent in community channels.
This decision is important and contentious enough to warrant involvement of the whole pDAO.
